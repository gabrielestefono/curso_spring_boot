If you have trouble with Spring Boot, we would like to help.

- Try the [How-to documents](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/index.html). They provide solutions to the most common questions.
- Learn the Spring basics. Spring Boot builds on many other Spring projects. Check the [spring.io](https://spring.io/) web-site for a wealth of reference documentation. If you are starting out with Spring, try one of the [guides](https://spring.io/guides).
- Ask a question. We monitor [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) for questions tagged with [`spring-boot`](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-boot).
- Report bugs with Spring Boot at [github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues).

> #### Note
> All of Spring Boot is open source, including the documentation. If you find problems with the docs or if you want to improve them, please [get involved](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot).
